# Hi, I'm Michael 👋

I'm a recent Bachelor of IT graduate from RMIT University in Melbourne with experience across software development, full‑stack web applications, cloud fundamentals and networking concepts. I enjoy working on projects where I can break down problems and understand how things are connected to create practical, well‑structured outcomes.
